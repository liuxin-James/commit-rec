By using non-DER or invalid encodings outside the signed portion of a
certificate the fingerprint can be changed without breaking the signature.
Although no details of the signed portion of the certificate can be changed
this can cause problems with some applications: e.g. those using the
certificate fingerprint for blacklists.

1. Reject signatures with non zero unused bits.

If the BIT STRING containing the signature has non zero unused bits reject
the signature. All current signature algorithms require zero unused bits.

2. Check certificate algorithm consistency.

Check the AlgorithmIdentifier inside TBS matches the one in the
certificate signature. NB: this will result in signature failure
errors for some broken certificates.

3. Check DSA/ECDSA signatures use DER.

Reencode DSA/ECDSA signatures and compare with the original received
signature. Return an error if there is a mismatch.

This will reject various cases including garbage after signature
(thanks to Antti Karjalainen and Tuomo Untinen from the Codenomicon CROSS
program for discovering this case) and use of BER or invalid ASN.1 INTEGERs
(negative or with leading zeroes).

This reduces the attack surface of local file-system
information leaking.

It prevents the existing exploit leading to an information leak. As
well as similar hypothetical attacks.

Leaks of information from files and symlinks ending in common multimedia extensions
are still possible. But files with sensitive information like private keys and passwords
generally do not use common multimedia filename extensions.
It does not stop leaks via remote addresses in the LAN.

The existing exploit depends on a specific decoder as well.
It does appear though that the exploit should be possible with any decoder.
The problem is that as long as sensitive information gets into the decoder,
the output of the decoder becomes sensitive as well.
The only obvious solution is to prevent access to sensitive information. Or to
disable hls or possibly some of its feature. More complex solutions like
checking the path to limit access to only subdirectories of the hls path may
work as an alternative. But such solutions are fragile and tricky to implement
portably and would not stop every possible attack nor would they work with all
valid hls files.

Developers have expressed their dislike / objected to disabling hls by default as well
as disabling hls with local files. There also where objections against restricting
remote url file extensions. This here is a less robust but also lower
inconvenience solution.
It can be applied stand alone or together with other solutions.
limiting the check to local files was suggested by nevcairiel

This recommits the security fix without the author name joke which was
originally requested by Nicolas.

The specification allows 2^32-1 to be encoded as any number of zeroes
greater than 31, followed by a one.  This previously failed because the
trace code would overflow the array containing the string representation
of the bits if there were more than 63 zeroes.  Fix that by splitting the
trace output into batches, and at the same time move it out of the default
path.

(While this seems likely to be a specification error, libaom does support
it so we probably should as well.)

Signed-off-by: Michael Niedermayer <michael@niedermayer.cc>","In libavformat/rmdec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in ivr_read_header() due to lack of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption. When a crafted IVR file, which claims a large ""len"" field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing data, is provided, the first type==4 loop would consume huge CPU resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop.",124eb202e70678539544f6268efc98131f19fa49,1

Signed-off-by: Michael Niedermayer <michael@niedermayer.cc>",A heap out-of-bounds memory write exists in FFMPEG since version 5.1. The size calculation in `build_open_gop_key_points()` goes through all entries in the loop and adds `sc->ctts_data[i].count` to `sc->sample_offsets_count`. This can lead to an integer overflow resulting in a small allocation with `av_calloc()`. An attacker can cause remote code execution via a malicious mp4 file. We recommend upgrading past commit c953baa084607dd1d84c3bfcce3cf6a87c3e6e05,c953baa084607dd1d84c3bfcce3cf6a87c3e6e05,1

In addition for MISP installation with custom roles, an org admin user could create a user assigned to new custom roles which were restricted to site admin. This could lead to the access of complementary permissions (except site admin, org admin and sync actions).
